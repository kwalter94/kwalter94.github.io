To kill the urge I decided to write something about my current day job (well I do not like it but it is unfortunately the only thing I think I smart enough to do). So, in this article I am going to explain what I think data engineering is, maybe go on to explain where it fits into software architecture, some of the techniques involved in it, and whatever else comes to mind as I write.</p><h2 id="what-is-data-engineering"><span class="mr-2">What is data engineering?</span><a href="#what-is-data-engineering" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Data engineering can be summarised as an activity that involves extraction of data from source systems and repackaging that data in such a way that makes it easy to do all sorts of analytics on it. As a software developer (I am assuming you are) you have probably built applications that did two things for your users. It solved some particular transactional problem for them and then provided a way for the users to extract some useful information from the application through reports.</p><p>Think of a stock management application, you have a transactional part to it that is responsible for collecting information about what goes into inventory and maybe overall facilitates the processes involved in moving items to and from the inventory. These are clearly two separate use cases and they are formally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">Online Transactional Processing (OLTP)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">Online Analytical Processsing (OLAP)</a> respectively. When modelling the database for this stock management application you will (unknowingly) optimise for one of these two use cases. For transactional processing, you need your writes and reads to be fast. You do not want to keep your users waiting for transactions to process. The transactions should at least be as fast as the users physically move goods to and from inventory. In addition, at this particular point in time users are not really interested in aggregate information such as how fast is product X getting restocked/depleted. However, at the end of the month the users might be interested in knowing how fast product X is getting depleted/restocked so that they can come up with a decision on the optimal time to restock the product. This is the analytical part and as you can see, users are not looking for an immediate answer. You have about a month to provide a response to this question (i.e. if you knew that the question was going to be asked before hand). For a report, a user is willing to click a button and wait for the system to process the data then provide an answer after some reasonable amount of time (say 5 minutes…).</p><p>The nature of the queries made to the database for these two use cases are quite different. For the transactional processing, the query is more row oriented. Give me product X, its price and all other related data. On the other hand, for the analytical processing you get queries that are more column oriented. For product X, I need the total amount that was spent in purchasing it. That question mostly focuses on aggregating a particular column over a number of rows. Modelling data for optimal performance and ease of use for each of these two use cases will lead you to two very different solutions. For efficient transactions, you will likely end up with some highly normalised model that makes extraction of rows from a database quite easy. And for the analytical work, you will likely end up with something not very normalised that makes column access quite efficient. This separation might even lead all the way to the choice of database engine (column-store vs row-store). Of course, for the simplest of applications, a single data model works. One feature of highly normalised databases is that they offer a high degree of query <a href="https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/choosing-a-database-with-pie/#introducing-the-pie-theorem">pattern flexibility</a> which allows you to torture the data models with any kind of question. However, what you get in flexibility is offset by a loss in either query performance or database scalability. Inevitably at some point, as you get a lot of data or the application gets significantly complex, you will need to have an additional data model to specifically address your analytical needs.</p><p>Data engineering is a discipline that bridges the gap between the transactional needs of an application and the analytical needs of the organisation the application serves. Data engineers (this name is unfortunate, IMHO they should be called data plumbers) are tasked with extracting the transactional data and optionally combining with data from other sources to produce datasets that can be easily analysed.</p><h2 id="approaches-to-data-extraction-and-processing"><span class="mr-2">Approaches to data extraction and processing</span><a href="#approaches-to-data-extraction-and-processing" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>There are two general approaches that are followed in capturing and processing of data from various source systems. The approaches are mostly informed by the nature of the analytical needs and to some extent the architecture of the source systems. Are you interested in realtime analytics (i.e. you need changes in the source system to be immediately be propagated to your analytical systems or maybe your analytics will be done at a later time)? Maybe you are interested in some combination of the two? Is your source system built around an event driven microservices architecture? The answer to these questions from a data engineering is either streaming or traditional Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) or some combination of the two.</p><h3 id="streaming"><span class="mr-2">Streaming</span><a href="#streaming" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>In streaming, you basically attach to event stream and you process the events as they come. Say, you are interested in reporting all error 500s that exceed a certain threshold in a given amount of time. I mean you could say, we want to know everytime a billion error 500s occur within a 5 minute period. In that case you can attach to a log stream and check whether the total number of errors that have occured in the last 5 minutes have hit a billion. You can then save that data as a new dataset or simply trigger some reporting jobs.</p><p>There are a number of tools out there in the wild that allow you to do these kinds of analytics. Of the top of my head I can think of <a href="https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos">Benthos</a>, <a href="https://spark.apache.org/streaming/">Spark Streaming</a>, and <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Flink</a>. Some of the features I look for when choosing a streaming solution include windowing and sliding of those windows. A window is just a period of time you want to focus on and a slide is all about how frequently you need that window to be moved. For example, you could say I want to look at data from the past 5 minutes (window) and I need this 5 minute window to progress forward in time after 2 minutes (slide). So, what happens in that case, is that the tool in use will buffer data for 5 minutes and make that data available to you as a single dataset so that you can do your analytical processing on it. These 5 minute windows can then be updated every two minutes with new data (you essentially have a dataset with data ranging from about 2 to 7 minutes ago).</p><p>You were probably expecting to hear something to do with <a href="https://https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>. Well, in my experience Kafka makes for a good starting point for your streaming solutions. You can think of it as a persistent log for your data streams. If you have a continuous stream of data you would first have it write to Kafka then you stream processing starts off from Kafka. In as much as you can directly attach to a service bus of your event driven application, you probably will want to buffer this data somewhere (that is where Kafka comes in).</p><h3 id="traditional-etl"><span class="mr-2">Traditional ETL</span><a href="#traditional-etl" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Forgive me for using the word “Traditional” here. Nowadays, the line between ETL and streaming is kind of getting too blurred to warrant a separate treatment of each of these techniques. Tools like Apache Flink actually do handle both ETL and Streaming under the same framework. Working in Flink makes you think “streaming-ish” even of you are working with a data source that is not a stream. In ETL, you have a data source that is not a stream for example an ordinary relational database. So, you pretty much grab all the available in source then process that data in a processing framework like <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Spark</a>. You may join this data to other datasets from different sources and at the end of all this you create new datasets.</p><p>This kind of workflow runs on a schedule. It could be something like, every 3 hours grab all the data from the source system and then process it somehow. Of course, you can include some techniques to only capture and process the changes in the data. In general though, you will be performing an extract, transform, and load at a given schedule. Tooling used for this include ordinary cron and something as sophisticated as <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a></p><p>One of the main gotchas with ETL is that you could end up putting a lot of stress on the source system with all the extraction work. Data extraction is a resource intensive process and could result in significant slowing down of the source system as the extraction process hogs all resources. This can be mitigated to some extent by setting replication to a different database and doing the extraction from thereon. This does work to some extent but it is not always the best solution. To work around this, it is quite common to resort to reading the database transaction log directly and then processing those logs in a style similar to stream processing. This reduces the load on the source system and eliminates the need to perform any sort of magic to determine what has changed in the data since the last extraction process. There is some tooling that has been built around this, examples include <a href="https://debezium.io">Debezium</a> and <a href="https://maxwells-daemon.io">Maxwell’s Daemon</a>. I tend to separate this from the other kind of ETL, thus I call the other kind of ETL just “traditional” ETL to differentiate it from this. This is still ETL but with a slightly different approach that is extremely close to stream processing.</p><h2 id="closing-words"><span class="mr-2">Closing words</span><a href="#closing-words" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>I have so much to say on this topic but I will leave it here now.

I hope to cover these some other day.
