A couple of days ago I run into a meme on Fred Brooks', No Silver Bullet.
I don't remember what exactly the meme was about or where I saw it, just
that it had something to do with this awesome paper. It happens to be one
of my favourite papers of all time in computing. The paper talks about
something that most of us software developers think and claim is obvious
but somehow we frequently ignore.

The biggest take away for me from that essay is that there are two main
sources of complexity in software. There is complexity that comes from
the inherent difficulty in the problem we are solving. This is called
essential complexity (complexity that emerges from the essence of the
problem we are trying to solve). There isn't too much that can be done
to get around this. Your solution regardless of what you do will tend
towards complexity because of it.

The other source of complexity happens to be around the choices we
make. Choices range from the tools we chose, all the way down to the
tiniest architectural choices. This is essentially self inflicted
pain and it is referred to as accidental complexity. You are trying
to build a simple CLI app and you decide to go with Java (could be
worse, PHP) because well, that's all you know. Your choice of language
there will be your main source of headaches.

Accidental complexity is an odd phenomenon. For something that I am
supposed to be in control of, it has been the main source of pain in
my career as a software developer (or programmer). There have been cases
where I have faced a problem that is indeed complex at its core but if
I am honest with myself, these are rare. For the most part, it is just
me fighting the tool that I am using to solve a particular problem.

ETBJ!!! Had this article stuck in draft for 3 months and completely
forgot about it... Publishing it as is.
